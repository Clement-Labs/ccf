# CCF Extended Outage

Dear CCF Users, as some of you may have noticed CCF went dark around 4pm EST yesterday (4 Apr). Our main Data Center experienced a power surge followed by a blackout coupled with a small fire event with their backup generator. The situation is being assessed as we speak. We hope to bring CCF back up and running in a short period of time but are looking at other options in case this proves to be an extended outage.
