# CCF Extended Outage

## Update 2
Hi CCFers, if you've been following the almost comical chain of events over at our Twitter page you'll know that we're still down. At this point we are looking at a full migration and restoration of CCF with a different provider (unless our Datacenter whom we really liked and made the Christmas card list until now can pull through with some updates). What this means is that we will restore CCF to our last backup which thankfully was Sunday morning (Apr 4). We prefer not to lose any content but if we continue to be offline we will be forced to go this route. More updates as they come.

## Update 1
Dear CCF Users, as some of you may have noticed CCF went dark around 4pm EST yesterday (4 Apr). Our main Data Center experienced a power surge followed by a blackout coupled with a small fire event with their backup generator. The situation is being assessed as we speak. We hope to bring CCF back up and running in a short period of time but are looking at other options in case this proves to be an extended outage.
